# Voximplant iOS SDK Swift PM

### ⚠️ Deprecation ⚠️
Since Apple is [deprecating bitcode tecnology](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14-release-notes#Deprecations), bitcode sdk release is deprecated as well. For nonbitcode sdk release, check: 
[ios-sdk-releases](https://github.com/voximplant/ios-sdk-releases).


This repository provides the access to the Voximplant iOS SDK for Swift Package Manager (bitcode version). 

Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program. Apps you upload to App Store Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store. Including bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the App Store.

Usage of bitcode libraries is not recommended for debug/testing builds because of its size.

Voximplant iOS SDK is distributed as a binary package (XCFramework) since 2.38.0.

Supported architectures:
- iphoneos: armv7, arm64
- iphonesimulator: i386, x86_64, arm64

Backward compatibility is only guaranteed for the patch version. API changes or a dependency update will increment the minor version.
